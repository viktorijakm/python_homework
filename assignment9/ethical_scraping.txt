Why websites use robots.txt:
Robots.txt files are used by websites to give directions to web crawlers and bots, informing them of the parts of the website that can or cannot be crawled. It prevents overloading of servers and protects sensitive or irrelevant content from scraping. It promotes ethical scraping as it enables the owners of websites to control their content use.
